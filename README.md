# async
Async is a customizable audio player designed to aid your sleep.
Play the sounds of traffic passing, thunder clapping or rain hitting your window to help you drift off and get the best sleep possible.

The main screen of the app features a dropdown menu with options for the main rain sound effect, which you can change to either soft or heavy. By default, three icons will also be featured on this screen, being window, thunder and settings icons.
The window icon changes the main sound effect to sound like it's being blocked by a window for both the soft and heavy modes.
The thunder icon plays thunder sound effects at random intervals.
The settings menu gives you the ability to customize your main menu, letting you choose which sound effects you'd like to be able to play.
